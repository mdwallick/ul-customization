# Universal Login Customization

This project is a collection of Auth0 UL customizations that I've created for one reason or another. Each
diretory has its own README describing what it does and how to set it up.

- [acul](./acul/) - Advanced Customization for Universal Login. [Auth0 Docs](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/login-pages/advanced-customizations)
- WIP [connection-switching](./connection-switching/) - page template and partials for switching connections during a transaction (e.g. start with password, switch to SMS passwordless)
- [dark-mode](./dark-mode/) - dark mode support for UL
- [language-selector](./language-picker/) - a simple language picker for UL
